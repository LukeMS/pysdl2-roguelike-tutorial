class Rect:
    """Object for storing rectangular coordinates."""

    def __init__(self, *args):
        """Initialization.

        Rect objects are used to store and manipulate rectangular areas. A
        Rect can be created from a combination of left, top, width, and
        height values. Rects can also be created from python objects that are
        already a Rect or have an attribute named “rect”.

        The Rect functions that change the position or size of a Rect return
        a new copy of the Rect with the affected changes. The original Rect
        is not modified. Some methods have an alternate “in-place” version
        that returns None but effects the original Rect. These “in-place”
        methods are denoted with the “ip” suffix.

        The Rect object has several virtual attributes which can be used to
        move and align the Rect:
        >>> x,y
        >>> top, left, bottom, right
        >>> topleft, bottomleft, topright, bottomright
        >>> midtop, midleft, midbottom, midright
        >>> center, centerx, centery
        >>> size, width, height
        >>> w,h

        All of these attributes can be assigned to:
        >>> rect1.right = 10
        >>> rect2.center = (20,30)

        Assigning to size, width or height changes the dimensions of the
        rectangle; all other assignments move the rectangle without resizing
        it. Notice that some attributes are integers and others are pairs of
        integers.

        If a Rect has a nonzero width or height, it will return True for a
        nonzero test. Some methods return a Rect with 0 size to represent an
        invalid rectangle.

        The coordinates for Rect objects are all integers. The size values
        can be programmed to have negative values, but these are considered
        illegal Rects for most operations.

        There are several collision tests between other rectangles. Most
        python containers can be searched for collisions against a single
        Rect.

        The area covered by a Rect does not include the right- and bottom-
        most edge of pixels. If one Rect’s bottom border is another Rect’s
        top border (i.e., rect1.bottom=rect2.top), the two meet exactly on
        the screen but do not overlap, and rect1.colliderect(rect2) returns
        false.

        The Rect class can be subclassed. Methods such as copy() and move()
        will recognize this and return instances of the subclass. However,
        the subclass’s __init__() method is not called, and __new__() is
        assumed to take no arguments. So these methods should be overridden
        if any extra attributes need to be copied.

        Args.:
            (4 int tuple; e.g. (left, top, width, height)); or
            (2 int tuple, i.e. one tuple for x and y coordinates, another
            for dimensions; e.g. "(left, top), (width, height)"); or
